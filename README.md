## Description

This code is the optimized version of Horiseon companies web page. With the company asking for help, I changed up all non semantic tags to semantic tags, such as changing divs to sections and articles and also adding a main section. I also went and added a meta tag and a descriptive Title along with descriptive alt tags for the images in order for search engine optimization, added comments and organized formating.
